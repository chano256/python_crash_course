# python_crash_course
This is a crash course for programmers with some experience in any other programming language. Includes the basics to an exercise and answers. Try the exercise without looking at the solutions then compare afterwards.

This was programmed in 'jupyter notebook' but you can try other ways with python.
You can also open with a text editor then try in the python terminal.
